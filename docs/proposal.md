**Abstract** — Counter is a domestic counter-to-counter parcel service.
A customer can send and recieve parcel from any of the verified counter across
the country. The service make sure that your parcel is secure using shape matching
to verify that your parcel was recived by the person it was inteded to be sent
to. This service will reduce theft and misplaced of parkages  happening in
counter to counter service. The project will be built with rasberry PI and
OpenCV

***Keywords — you can write the name and methods that you use here: Raspberry***
***pi, Finite state machine, Multiplexers, detection algorithm name, etc  ( 4 or 5***
**key words are enough )**

 ### Introduction

Write this part in  paragraph
The first paragraph gives a general idea of the current world and how lives has
been affected by the new technology and methods of detection. (Please read some
document on shape recognition in security and give at least two reference that
are accessible so that I might be able to check your reference) when you
reference a document cite it as [1] and if the reference section [1] should be
the reference you tagged as [1]

The second paragraph should indicate what other people have done in the field
of security recognition. What are the  similar projects and please write this
as reference (you need to give 4 to 6 reference ) Please write this as though
you are telling the story.

The third paragraph should emphasize on the method that you have decided and
why you have decided to used is. (if you have different methods for each
methods you have 1 paragraph) you can support you choice with 1 or 2 reference

The fourth paragrath should tell us about the benefits of this project, what
are we gaining in implementing this project.

The last paragraph now is about the organization of the Report :  (Leave it as
it is as I am writing it for you ) : The remainder of this report is organized
as follow: Section two discuss the background and related work on “ Fill in the
name of your project”. Section 3 shown the methods used for this project.
Section 4: Shows the simulation obtained while section 5 discuss the obtained
results.Finally section 6 conclude the report. 


### Background: related work

First paragraph talk again about your project and its impact in our modern society.
 Choose 2 or 3 projects that you know, that have been are close to your project and explain why those projects are close to yours and how are they important. 
The last paragraph of this section tells why your project is good and why is it different with other projects.

### Methods
This parts speaks about the methods that you will use to implement the project.
The methods for us will be mostly Finite sate machine, multiplexer, shape
detection methods. For each methods that you decide to use, present them in
paragraph

1. Operations of the projects \
Explain all the algorithm that you are using here. List them as A, B C … (2 or
3 algorithms are enough.) Algorithm. Flow chart of your project can be put
here. You can use any software to draw it and copy the image here ( Please
don’t draw it with words )

2. Algorithms \
Explain all the algorithm that you are using here. List them as A, B C … (2 algorithms are enough.) Algorithm/
Flow chart should be used to explain your algorithm.
After explaining the algorithm, you can summarize it as follow:

*Algorithm* \
Start the project
Upload the image 
Check if the shape is recognized ?
Does it match with any stored or acknowledge shape
Give the output message

This is just an example that I have made for you. You can customize it as you want.

3. Equations
If you have equations in your report please type them using the recommendation below
The equations are an exception to the prescribed specifications of this
template. You will need to determine whether or not your equation should be
typed using either the Times New Roman or the Symbol font (please no other
font). 

### Simualtions 

Here you can put figures or images of your software simulations, the outputs
waves of Quartus can be placed and explain each figure. Put some pictures of
your projects simulations, some LCD display output.

*Figures and Tables*
 Positioning Figures and Tables: Place figures and tables at the top and bottom
 of columns. Avoid placing them in the middle of columns. Large figures and
 tables may span across both columns. Figure captions should be below the
 figures; table heads should appear above the tables. Insert figures and tables
 after they are cited in the text. Use the abbreviation “Fig. 1”, even at the
 beginning of a sentence.
 
| Table head     | Table Head   | Column 3     |
| :------------- | :----------: | -----------: |
|                | More Stuff   | And Again    |

subsection{Specifications }
    • Wait sensor  will sense a wait of o.1 kg and above and then trigger shape d
    • A camera will be used to capture the shape of your head
    • Shape of the head will be stored for the for as long as the parcel that wei
    • The face will be automatically flashed out once the parcel has been collect
    • Alternative a pin will be requested if the face detected doesn’t match for
    • A keypad will be used to key in the pin
    • LCD screen will be used to display the pin in asterisks for safety purposes

subsection{Introduction}
Parcel counter is where people keep their parcels when entering a store.
Attendant gives you a ticket/card to produce as proof that you left your things
with them. It’s safe an reliable but what happens  if you lost the
ticket/card? Do they give you your things? Do you have to pay for them? Our aim
is to reduce losses of parcel in the parcel counters by making the parcel
counter attendant free.

Example of a figure caption. (figure caption)
Figure Labels: Use 8 point Times New Roman for Figure labels. Use words rather than symbols or abbreviations when writing Figure axis labels to avoid confusing the reader. As an example, write the quantity “Magnetization”, or
Discussions
Discuss all the results of your projects Discuss what you have achieve and tell us why it is important. Explain every output figure that you have. What it does and how you understand it.
Conclusion
Conclude your paper efficiently by giving the overall statement of your project. State what you have achieved and why it was important achieving. If possible give
