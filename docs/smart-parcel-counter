\section{Abstract}
\textbf{
- Smart Parcel Counter is a domestic counter-to-counter parcel service.
A customer can send and recieve parcel from any of the verified counter across 
the country. The service make sure that your parcel is secure using shape matching 
to verify that your parcel was recived by the person it was inteded to be sent
to. This service will reduce theft and misplaced of parkages  happening in 
counter to counter service. The project will be built with rasberry PI and 
OpenCV

Keywords — you can write the name and methods that you use here:  Raspberry pi,
Finite state machine, Multiplexers, detection algorithm name, etc  ( 4 or 5 key
words are enough )

\subsection{Introduction}
Write this part in  paragraph
The first paragraph gives a general idea of the current world and how lives has
been affected by the new technology and methods of detection. (Please read some
document on shape recognition in security and give at least two reference that
are accessible so that I might be able to check your reference) when you
reference a document cite it as [1] and if the reference section [1] should be
the reference you tagged as [1]


The second paragraph should indicate what other people have done in the field
of security recognition. What are the  similar projects and please write this
as reference (you need to give 4 to 6 reference ) Please write this as though
you are telling the story.


The third paragraph should emphasize on the method that you have decided and
why you have decided to used is. (if you have different methods for each
methods you have 1 paragraph) you can support you choice with 1 or 2 reference


The fourth paragrath should tell us about the benefits of this project, what
are we gaining in implementing this project.

The remainder of this report is organized as follow: Section two discuss the
background and related work on A secure parcel counter. Section 3
shown the methods used for this project.  Section 4: Shows the simulation
obtained while section 5 discuss the obtained results. Finally section 6
conclude the report. 

\subsection{Background : related work}
First paragraph talk again about your project and its impact in our modern
society.
Choose 2 or 3 projects that you know, that have been are close to your project
and explain why those projects are close to yours and how are they important.
The last paragraph of this section tells why your project is good and why is
it different with other projects.


\subsection{Methods}
This parts speaks about the methods that you will use to implement the project.
The methods for us will be mostly Finite sate machine, multiplexer, shape
detection methods. For each methods that you decide to use, present them in
paragraph

\subsection{Operations of the project}
Explain all the algorithm that you are using here. List them as A, B C … (2 or
3 algorithms are enough.) Algorithm. Flow chart of your project can be put
here. You can use any software to draw it and copy the image here ( Please
don’t draw it with words )

\subsection{Algorithms}
Explain all the algorithm that you are using here. List them as A, B C … (2 algorithms are enough.) Algorithm/
Flow chart should be used to explain your algorithm.
After explaining the algorithm, you can summarize it as follow:

\subsection{Algorithm 1:}
Start the project
Upload the image 
Check if the shape is recognized ?
Does it match with any stored or acknowledge shape
Give the output message


===================================================================
\subsection{Specifications }
    • Wait sensor  will sense a wait of o.1 kg and above and then trigger shape detection
    • A camera will be used to capture the shape of your head
    • Shape of the head will be stored for the for as long as the parcel that weighs 0.1kg or above is kept on the counter
    • The face will be automatically flashed out once the parcel has been collected 
    • Alternative a pin will be requested if the face detected doesn’t match for max of 5 attempts 
    • A keypad will be used to key in the pin
    • LCD screen will be used to display the pin in asterisks for safety purposes

\subsection{Introduction}
Parcel counter is where people keep their parcels when entering a store.
Attendant gives you a ticket/card to produce as proof that you left your things
with them. It’s safe and reliable but what happens  if you lost the
ticket/card? Do they give you your things? Do you have to pay for them? Our aim
is to reduce losses of parcel in the parcel counters by making the parcel
counter attendant free.
